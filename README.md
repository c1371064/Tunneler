## Summary
Eventually I hope to make this a front end for SSH tunnel management similar to Zenmap for nmap.
Tunneler will establish SSH tunnels, to include dynamically routing tunnels through each other while
keeping track of the start and end of multi-layered tunnels. 

This is my attempt to get back into programming so development will likely be slow. Short term dev goals
for now:
* Code clean up
  * I want this to be easy to read, not the spaghetti code it is now.
* Adding features to the GUI
  * Port specification
  * private key selection
  * password field (maybe)
